# Cyber Incident Tracker

This project is aimed at building a tool to provide real-time feeds of cyber incidents related to Indian cyberspace. It involves collecting, classifying, and visualizing data on cyber incidents using machine learning and other web technologies.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Collection**: Crawling/scraping various platforms (e.g., forums, social media, vulnerability databases) for cyber incident reports and details.
2. **Classification**: Using machine learning models to identify the legitimacy, threat levels, and relevance of the incidents.
3. **Storage and Visualization**: Storing processed data in a structured database and visualizing it via a web application to provide insights on specific sectors, APTs, and other strategic issues.

## Objectives

- Provide real-time information on cyber threats and incidents specific to Indian cyberspace.
- Enhance the threat assessment potential based on past and current incidents.
- Empower organizations to take necessary actions to mitigate further risks.
